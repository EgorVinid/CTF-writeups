# Description
Hey I've gotten this rock, but I don't know what I can get out of it. 
It's pretty heavy, and apparently it's made out of Osmium, I was told. See if you can extract anything out of it for me.
HINT: 
This rock has been sitting under huge amounts of pressure for a pretty long time. 
It seems highly compressed and contaminated with a bunch of tar and slags too. 
There doesn't seem to be any regular pattern to the tar contamination and compression that it experienced though...
